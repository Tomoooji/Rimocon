memos:
- I want to add "mode" (includes switchMode function) to buttons
- should be 0 if it isn't used

- Maybe I shoud choose making another class from button... (because of readAll/getAll/detectAll functions)

- swithch from constructor of Toggle and Joystick

---
- I also need to make Timer class (or something like that)...
